<div class="list"><div class="block"></div>What is Prohealth?</div>
<div class="answer">Hygeia HMO offers an affordable health plan that allows you visit a doctor, do laboratory tests, get free drugs, do surgery and more in over 1,000 hospitals across Nigeria, without paying.</div>
<div class="list"><div class="block"></div>Why should I buy this plan?</div>
<div class="answer">1. If you buy, you would not be burdened with hospital cost if you or your family member falls ill.</div>
<div class="answer">2. Because you do not know when you would fall sick, and Prohealth is NOT sold to already sick individuals.</div>
<div class="list"><div class="block"></div>How do I know this is not a scam?</div>
<div class="answer">We advise customers who are skeptical to get confirmation from the closest hospitals around them.</div>
<div class="list"><div class="block"></div>How do I pay so little and gain so much? </div>
<div class="answer">Getting a health plan is not new to people in corporate organisations, in order to cater for the average Nigerian, we have designed a pocket friendly, realistic and affordable plan with flexible payment. </div>
<div class="list"><div class="block"></div>Can I visit the hospital if I have not completed my payment?</div>
<div class="answer">Cards are only processed after complete payment, hence we advise people complete payment as soon as they can, so as to give them access to care quickly.</div>
<div class="list"><div class="block"></div>Does this mean it covers all sickness?</div>
<div class="answer">Covers MOST COMMON ailments but not all ailments</div>
<div class="list"><div class="block"></div>Can I go to Any hospital? </div>
<div class="answer">You have access to over 1,000 carefully selected private hospitals across the country. Please request for the hospital list.</div>
<div class="list"><div class="block"></div>After seeing the doctor, do I have to pay for my drugs? </div>
<div class="answer">Your drugs are free to the benefit limit.</div>
<div class="list"><div class="block"></div>Can I go to any pharmacy and get drugs?</div>
<div class="answer">Your doctor would prescribe the drug(s), which you would take to the pharmacy, every drug comes only with a prescription and recommendation from the doctor, so as to prevent self medication and drug abuse.</div>
<div class="list"><div class="block"></div>How long do I have to wait to get my card?</div>
<div class="answer">After full payment, it takes 14-30 days to get your car</div>

<div class="answer">Yes, it covers ROUTINE immunization for babies</div>
 <div class="list"><div class="block"></div>Can I buy if I am pregnant?</div>
<div class="answer">Yes you can BUT all antenatal and delivery services would not be covered until after 10 MONTHS of being on the plan. This is to prevent adverse selection(a situation where only pregnant people buy the policy)</div>
<div class="list"><div class="block"></div>Can I do surgery immediately I get my card?</div>
<div class="answer">   Surgery,optical care and dental care have a 6 months waiting period.</div>
<div class="list"><div class="block"></div>What happens if I exceed my limits?</div>
<div class="answer"> Our limts are quite generous and not likely to be exceeded but in the rare case that such happens, you would have to pay the little difference out of pocket.</div>
<div class="list"><div class="block"></div>What if I don't fall sick through out the year? </div>
<div class="answer">OUr policies are designed to protect you against the uncertainty of you falling ill, hence the policy is valid for a year, after which a policy holder is expected to renew to enjoy the plan.</div>
<div class="list"><div class="block"></div>Are all policies beneficial to the family?</div>
<div class="answer">Every plan apart from the family is directed to individuals.</div>
